<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Rajashri Bhamare, and I am a 20-year-old undergraduate student from Maharashtra, India. Currently,<br  />
   I am in my third year of studies, focusing on honing my skills and knowledge in the field of web development.<br />
  With a strong interest in web technologies, I am dedicated to exploring and mastering various aspects of<br />
   web development to build a solid foundation for my future career..</p>

<p>In my second year as an Electrical and Computer Engineering student, I enrolled in a course that required us to 
  design a project integrating both hardware and software. While I was confident in the electrical aspects, the
   software side was less familiar to me. One of the project options involved creating a simple web interface to 
   control an embedded systemâ€”a concept that immediately piqued my interest.
